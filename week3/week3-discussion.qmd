### Example 1

```{r}
#| fig-alt: "A histogram of body mass measurements (in grams) by penguin species showing that Gentoo penguins have higher body mass than Adelie or Chinstrap penguins by x grams."
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| echo: false
library(ggplot2)
library(palmerpenguins)

ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g, fill = species)) +
  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.5, 
                 position = "identity") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  labs(x = "Body mass (g)",
       y = "Frequency",
       title = "Penguin body masses")
```

### Example 2
